//! Shared input builder for the zkID RS256 split circuits.

//! Produces cert-chain + device-sig JSON inputs from raw certificate DER,
//! signatures, and SMT non-membership proof. Consumed by `ecdsa-spartan2`
//! (native prover) and `spartan2-wasm` (in-browser prover) so both paths
//! produce byte-identical JSON — which is the safeguard against reintroducing
//! witness-input shape errors such as
//! "Too many values for input signal __placeholder__".
